# Brca2_mammary
A transcriptional response to replication stress selectively expands a subset of BRCA2-mutant mammary epithelial cells

# Overview
This is the repository of scripts and data used for the paper "A transcriptional response to replication stress selectively expands a subset of BRCA2-mutant mammary epithelial cells"

# Documenation
Custom code was not generated for this manuscript. The following publicly available pipelines were utilized for analysis: raw sequencing data were processed using the 10X Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline (https://github.com/10XGenomics/cellranger), standard preprocessing and quality control of scRNA-seq data was based on Seurat Guided tutorials (http://satijalab.org/seurat/). 

# System Requirements
## Software version
R Version: 4.1.3 
Cell Ranger version: 6.0.2 
Seurat version: 4.0

## Hardware requirement 
Requires only a standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations

### R Dependencies
The image generation R-scripts depend on the following packages.

```
Seurat
dplyr
cowplot
